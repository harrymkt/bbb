# the camera.
The camera allows you to see what's around you in the game. It can be useful for looking for edges of platforms, above or below you, and locating a multitude of other things. Here's how it works.

to use the camera, you must be holding the g key.

while the g key is down, the following keys can be used.

* Up, down, left and right arrows: Move your camera. It will play sounds at the camera's location on what it finds, e.g. walls, air, tiles, hazard, etc.
* f: check the camera coordinates. it will tell with the tile name. a danger hazard means you'll instantly die If you stepped on it, freezing means you'll instantly die If you stepped on it, and air means you'll fall down If you stepped on it.
* backslash: toggles the mfwc. mfwc(move focus with camera) allows you to view the camera in the same coordinates as you.
* l: check the camera's location.
* v: play the camera tile again.
* page up/down: move the camera above or below you.

keep in mind that some maps cannot be used the camera If it is disabled.
