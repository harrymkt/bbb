# introduction to builder

welcome to the building guide!

this guide's purpose is to be able to add map objects through the raw data, not from the builder menu. since builder menu is promted by virtual form dialogs, you won't have any problem. however, working with raw data, specificly on your favorite text editor, is required that you learn the syntax of the  object you want to build.

every parse is seperated by a colon character (`:`) in the raw data. even though after you build through the builder menu, you will see the syntaxes on the lines of the map data and therefore it is also possible for you to be learned the objects that are or are not documented within the documentations.

remember the following:
* The **minX** (minimum x) is the leftmost x of what you are building.
* The **maxX** (maximum x) is the rightmost x of what you are building.
* The **minY** (minimum y) is the bottom most y of what you are building.
* The **maxY** (maximum y) is the bottom most y of what you are building.
* The **minZ** (minimum z) is the minimum height of what you are building.
* The **maxZ** (maximum z) is the maximum height of what you are building.

to start, read the document you want to learn in the list above.
