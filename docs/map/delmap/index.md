# deleting a map

deleting a map is very easy. first, make sure that:
* you are an owner of the map you want to delete. this does not apply for staff admin or higher.
* the map is not in challenge maps. this does not apply for staff admin or higher.

If you are a staff member, be warned that you have no permission to delete player created maps whatsoever, accept that the maps are aline with removal reasons, and If they are spam, or any similar cases.

## deleting a map.

you have 2 options.

### deleting from a command

the command that can delete a map is `/delmap` or `/delmap <mapname>`.

If the mapname parameter is omited, the command will try to initiate your current map.

### map setting

you have another option, that is from the map settings menu. the option is the same as typeing command, accept you do not need to type yourself. the option will type the command itself on behalf of you.

disadvantage is that the option can only try to delete the current map.

to delete the map using this option, go to map settings. the map settings can be accessed using from the builder menu, or pressing **shift+b**.

next, click on `delete the map`. it will ask 1 last confirmation message, asking whether you would like to delete or not.
